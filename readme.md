Welcome to the **Sample AI Chat Application**! This project is a showcase of my skills in Android
development using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**. It’s designed to demonstrate my ability to
build modern, clean, and scalable Android applications. Whether you're a recruiter, fellow
developer, or just curious, feel free to explore the code and see what I’ve built! 🚀

## 👨‍💻 Developer

Hi there! I'm **Emirhan Kolver**, a passionate Android developer who loves building intuitive and
efficient apps. This project is a reflection of my skills and dedication to learning and
implementing best practices in Android development. Let’s connect

## 🛠️ Main Features

This app is built with the following key features and technologies:

### 1. **MVVM Architecture** 🏗️

The app follows the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture to ensure a clean separation of
concerns. This makes the codebase more maintainable, testable, and scalable.

### 2. **Dependency Injection** 💉

I’ve used **Dependency Injection** (with Hilt) to manage dependencies efficiently. This improves
code reusability, testability, and overall app performance.

### 3. **Room Database** 🗄️

The app uses **Room** for local data persistence. This ensures that chat history and other important
data are stored securely and efficiently on the device.

### 4. **Dark Mode** 🌙

The app uses Material3 color palette efficiently to provide a seamless dark mode experience. 
It automatically adapts to the system theme and ensures a comfortable viewing experience in 
low-light environments.
